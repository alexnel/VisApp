# VisApp
Self-Organising Map Visualisation application

To run the VisApp:

Open the terminal.
Navigate to the VisApp file.
$chmod +x run.sh

If you wish to add your own dataset, add your textfile to the VisApp directory. Ensure the data has no preamble. Every new line must represent a new input vector. The features must be separated by a space or tab.
